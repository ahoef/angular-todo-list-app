This dashboard app is built with AngularJS, Gulp.js, Sass, browser geolocation, and the Weather Underground API. It uses the Angular ui-sortable directive to enable drag + drop list reordering, and it also uses the Angular local storage module to persist data in browsers. Feel free to create pull requests with bug fixes or new features!
